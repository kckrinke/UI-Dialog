UI-Dialog
=========

UI::Dialog is a OOPerl wrapper for the various dialog applications. These
dialog backends are currently supported: Zenity, GDialog, XDialog, KDialog,
CDialog, and Whiptail. There is also an ASCII backend provided as a last
resort interface for the console based dialog variants. UI::Dialog is a
class that provides a strict interface to these various backend modules.
By using UI:Dialog (with it's imposed limitations on the widgets) you can
ensure that your Perl program will function with any available interfaces.

UI::Dialog supports priority ordering of the backend detection process. So
if you'd prefer that Xdialog should be used first if available, simply
designate the desired order when creating the new object. The default order
for detecting and utilization of the backends are as follows:
  (with DISPLAY env): Zenity, GDialog, XDialog, KDialog
  (without DISPLAY): CDialog, Whiptail, ASCII


INSTALLATION
------------

To install this module type the following:

   perl Makefile.PL
   make
   make test
   make install


SPECIAL NOTES
-------------

This release of UI::Dialog fundamentally changes how some internal mechanics
function, namely the new `trust-input` behaviour for handling argument input
(not user-input but rather programmer input). Every backend needed to have
core functionality altered for this release and while the author has tried
their best to test all the backends as thoroughly as possible; this has
proven to require more time than they could invest.

Developers should not need to adjust their use of UI::Dialog unless they
need to enable the `trust-input` feature. See `examples/trust-input.pl` for
example usage (or check the unit-tests, most have been updated for this
specific feature).

In the end, this release considers the XDialog backend to be "untested"
and it is entirely possible that this backend is fundamentally broken at
this time. XDialog is untested because it's unbuildable on Debian Jessie.
This is a whole different problem, well beyond the scope of this release.

In addition to XDialog, KDialog is also considered untested and potentially
broken in fundamental ways.

If you use either of these backends, or are just willing to help, please
try the backends out (with this release of UI::Dialog) however you can.

Detailed bugreports are very welcome. Unit tests, patches and anything
else that can help the project along are even more appreciated. Please
use the GitHub issue tracker[0] (or CPAN request tracker[1]) to provide
your reports.

These backends are of value and priority to UI::Dialog and given feedback,
a followup bugfix release of UI::Dialog will be pushed out in a higher
priority fashion. However, given little or no feedback, the assumption will
be that either nobody uses these backends (highly doubted) or that they
are functional as-is and not needing any fixes.
