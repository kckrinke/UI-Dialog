UI::Dialog

=head1 SYNOPSIS

  use UI::Dialog;
  my $d = new UI::Dialog ( backtitle => 'Demo', title => 'Default',
                           height => 20, width => 65 , listheight => 5,
                           order => [ 'zenity', 'xdialog' ] );

  # Either a Zenity or Xdialog msgbox widget should popup,
  # with a preference for Zenity.
  $d->msgbox( title => 'Welcome!', text => 'Welcome one and all!' );

=head1 ABSTRACT

UI::Dialog is a OOPerl wrapper for the various dialog applications. These
dialog backends are currently supported: Zenity, XDialog, GDialog, KDialog,
CDialog, and Whiptail. There is also an ASCII backend provided as a last
resort interface for the console based dialog variants. UI::Dialog is a
class that provides a strict interface to these various backend modules.
By using UI:Dialog (with it's imposed limitations on the widgets) you can
ensure that your Perl program will function with any available interfaces.

=head1 DESCRIPTION

UI::Dialog supports priority ordering of the backend detection process. So
if you'd prefer that Xdialog should be used first if available, simply
designate the desired order when creating the new object. The default order
for detecting and utilization of the backends are as follows:
  (with DISPLAY env): Zenity, GDialog, XDialog, KDialog
  (without DISPLAY): CDialog, Whiptail, ASCII

UI::Dialog is the result of a complete re-write of the UDPM CPAN module. This
was done to break away from the bad choice of name (UserDialogPerlModule) and
to implement a cleaner, more detached, OOPerl interface.

=item DESCRIPTION

=over 6

This is the Class Constructor method. It accepts a list of key => value pairs
and uses them as the defaults when interacting with the various widgets.

=back

=item RETURNS

=over 6

A blessed object reference of the UI::Dialog class.

=back

=item OPTIONS

The (...)'s after each option indicate the default for the option. An * denotes
support by all the widget methods on a per-use policy defaulting to the values
decided during object creation.

=item DESCRIPTION

=over 6

Present the end user with a message box that has two buttons, yes and no.

=back

=item RETURNS

TRUE (1) for a response of YES or FALSE (0) for anything else.

 my $string = $d->password( text => 'Enter some hidden text.' );

=back

=item DESCRIPTION

=over 6

Present the end user with a text input field, that has hidden input, and a message.

Note that the GDialog backend will provide a regular inputbox instead of a password
box because gdialog doesn't support passwords. GDialog is on it's way to the proverbial
software heaven so this isn't a real problem. Use Zenity instead :)
